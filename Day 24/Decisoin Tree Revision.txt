Decision Tree and Random Forest
----------------------------------
Step 1: Loaded the training Dataset - processed the dataset

Step 2: Initialise the Decision Tree

step 3: Model 1 - [DV - Survived and IDV - Sex]

Step 4: Model 2 - [DV - Survived and IDV - Sex and Pclass]

Step 5: Model 3 - [DV - Survived and IDV - Sex, Age, Pclass and Fare] -8

Step 6: Accuracy Score

Step 7: Loaded the Test Dataset and processed the dataset

Step 8: Based on the training Dataset predicted the test dataset output

Step 9: Prunning - Random Forest Classifier

Step 10: Identification of important IDV for Decision Tree
